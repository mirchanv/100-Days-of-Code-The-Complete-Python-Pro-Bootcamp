# 🔐 PyPassword Generator

### 📖 Project Description

PyPassword Generator is a command-line Python application that generates strong, random passwords based on user-defined criteria. The user specifies how many letters, numbers, and symbols they want, and the program creates a randomized password that combines all selected character types.

This project focuses on practicing Python fundamentals while introducing basic concepts related to password strength and randomness.

### 🎯 Objective

Generate a secure and customizable password by combining letters, numbers, and symbols in a random order based on user input.

### 🕹️ How the Program Works
1. The user is prompted to choose how many letters, symbols, and numbers the password should contain. 
2. Random characters are selected from predefined lists. 
3. Characters are stored in a list and shuffled to ensure randomness. 
4. Shuffled characters are joined to form the final password. 
5. Generated password is displayed to the user.
