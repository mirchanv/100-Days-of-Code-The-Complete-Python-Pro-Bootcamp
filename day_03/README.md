# 🏝️ Treasure Island Project 
Treasure Island is a text-based adventure game built in Python where the player navigates through a series of choices to find hidden treasure. Each decision affects the outcome of the game, leading either closer to victory or to a “Game Over” scenario. The project is designed to demonstrate core Python programming fundamentals through an interactive command-line experience.

### Concepts Practised
- Control Flow with if / else and Conditional Operators
