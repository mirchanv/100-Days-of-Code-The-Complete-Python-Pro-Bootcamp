# 🧮 Calculator Application

## 📖 Project Overview
This project is a command-line **Calculator Application** built using Python. The program allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—through an interactive interface. It supports continuous calculations using previous results and provides options to start a new calculation or exit the application. An ASCII logo is displayed at startup for improved user experience.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand and implement functions in Python
- Learn how to store functions as values and use them dynamically
- Practice using dictionaries to map operations to functions
- Strengthen control flow using loops and conditionals
- Build an interactive command-line application
