# 🃏 Blackjack Game

## 📖 Project Overview
This project is a **command-line Blackjack game** built in Python as part of the  
**100 Days of Code™: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp** by Angela Yu.

The game simulates a simplified version of Blackjack and focuses on clean logic,
modular functions, and user interaction through the terminal.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Break down a real-world game into logical steps
- Strengthen understanding of Python functions and return values
- Work with lists to represent hands of cards
- Apply conditional logic to implement Blackjack rules
- Build interactive command-line applications

---

## 🕹️ Key Features
- Random card dealing using Python’s `random` module
- Automatic handling of Blackjack (21 with two cards)
- Ace value adjustment (11 → 1) to prevent busting
- Player decision-making (hit or stand)
- Computer dealer logic (hits until score ≥ 17)
- Replay functionality without restarting the program

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered
- Functions and modular code design
- Lists and list manipulation
- Conditional statements (`if / elif / else`)
- Loops (`while`)
- Recursion (restarting the game)
- Docstrings and readable code
- Randomization and game state tracking

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Python Standard Library:
  - `random`
- Custom module:
  - `art.py` (ASCII logo display)

---

## 📌 Game Rules Implemented
- Number cards count as their face value
- Face cards (J, Q, K) count as 10
- Ace counts as 11 or 1 (automatic adjustment)
- Blackjack is a score of 21 with two cards
- Dealer draws until reaching at least 17

---

## 📌 Purpose
The purpose of this project is to reinforce **foundational Python skills**
by recreating a familiar game scenario and translating real-world rules into code.

---

## ✅ Outcome
By completing this project, the learner gains:
- Confidence in writing interactive Python programs
- Experience modeling real-world rules in code
- Improved understanding of program flow and state management
- A solid mini-project suitable for a beginner Python portfolio
