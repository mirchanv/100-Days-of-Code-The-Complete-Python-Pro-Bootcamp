# 💻 Day 18 – Turtle Graphics & Pattern Generation (Python)

## 📖 Project Overview
Day 18 focuses on graphical programming using Python’s built-in Turtle module.

This folder contains multiple visual experiments that explore:

- Random walk simulations
- Spirograph pattern generation
- RGB color manipulation
- Directional movement and heading control
- Algorithmic pattern creation

These programs combine mathematics, randomness, and structured loops to generate dynamic graphical output on screen.
