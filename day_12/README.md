# 💻 Number Guessing Game (Python)

## 📖 Project Overview
This project is an interactive **command-line Number Guessing Game** built in Python as part of the **100 Days of Code™: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp** by Angela Yu.

The program randomly selects a number between **1 and 100**, and the player must guess the number within a limited number of attempts. The game includes two difficulty levels that adjust the number of guesses, reinforcing decision-making and control flow concepts.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Practice using functions to organize game logic
- Understand random number generation in Python
- Apply conditional logic to compare values
- Work with loops to control game flow
- Handle user input and feedback

---

## 🕹️ Key Features
- Random number generation between 1 and 100
- Two difficulty levels:
  - Easy mode (10 attempts)
  - Hard mode (5 attempts)
- Real-time feedback for guesses (too high / too low)
- Attempt tracking and game-ending conditions
- Clear win and lose outcomes

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered
- Functions and return values
- Conditional statements (`if / elif / else`)
- While loops for repeated guessing
- User input handling
- Game state management
- Modular and readable code design

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Python Standard Library:
  - `random`
- Custom module:
  - `art.py` (ASCII logo display)

---

## 📌 Game Rules
- The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100
- The player chooses a difficulty level
- Each incorrect guess reduces the remaining attempts
- The game ends when:
  - The player guesses correctly, or
  - The player runs out of attempts

---

## 📌 Purpose
The purpose of this project is to strengthen **core Python programming skills** by implementing a simple but complete game loop. It focuses on logic, flow control, and user interaction—key foundations for larger applications.

---

## ✅ Outcome
By completing this project, the learner gains:
- Confidence working with loops and conditionals
- Experience structuring small Python programs
- Improved understanding of game logic and state
- A solid beginner-friendly project for a Python portfolio
