# 🐢🏁 Turtle Race Game

## 📖 Project Overview
This project is a graphical turtle racing game built using Python’s Turtle graphics module.

Users place a bet on which colored turtle will win the race. Multiple turtles start from the left side of the screen and move forward randomly until one crosses the finish line. Once a winner is determined, the program compares the result with the user’s bet and displays the outcome.

The project demonstrates event-driven graphics, randomness, loop control, and clean procedural structure.

## 🧩 Architecture Overview

The application follows a clear three-layer structure:

### 1️⃣ Setup Layer
- Screen configuration
- Constants for start and finish lines
- Turtle initialization and positioning

### 2️⃣ Game Logic Layer
- Random turtle selection
- Random forward movement
- Finish line detection
- Race loop control

### 3️⃣ Result Layer
- Winning turtle detection
- User bet comparison
- Console output of race result

This separation keeps the code readable, maintainable, and easy to extend.

## 🎮 How It Works

1. The screen initializes with a defined width and height.
2. Six turtles of different colors are positioned at the starting line.
3. The user enters a bet on which turtle color will win.
4. The race begins:
   - A random turtle moves forward by a random amount.
   - The loop continues until one turtle crosses the finish line.
5. The winner is declared and compared with the user's bet.

## 📌 Purpose

The purpose of this project is to simulate a simple racing game while reinforcing:

- Loop control logic
- Randomized behavior
- Object manipulation
- Clean function-based architecture

It strengthens foundational programming concepts in a fun and visual way.
