# 💻 Quiz Game Application (Python OOP Project)

## 📖 Project Overview
This project is a command-line **Quiz Game Application** built in Python using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

The application presents a series of True/False questions to the user, tracks their score in real time, and manages quiz progression through a modular, class-based architecture.

The project is structured across multiple files to demonstrate clean separation of concerns and scalable software design.

Project Modules:

- `data.py` → Stores raw question data  
- `question_model.py` → Defines the Question data model  
- `quiz_brain.py` → Handles quiz logic and state management  
- `main.py` → Application entry point  

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Apply Object-Oriented Programming principles in Python
- Separate responsibilities across multiple modules
- Design and instantiate custom classes
- Manage application state effectively

## 🧩 Architecture Overview
The project follows a layered architecture pattern:

- **Data Layer** → `data.py` (question dataset)
- **Model Layer** → `question_model.py` (Question class definition)
- **Logic Layer** → `quiz_brain.py` (Quiz flow and score management)
- **Execution Layer** → `main.py` (program entry point)

This separation improves:

- Readability
- Maintainability
- Scalability
- Testability
- Reusability of components

The `QuizBrain` class manages the application state independently from the data source, demonstrating clean abstraction.

## 📌 Purpose
The purpose of this project is to move beyond simple scripting and develop a structured, modular application using Object-Oriented Programming principles.

It reinforces the transition from writing linear scripts to designing maintainable systems composed of reusable components — an essential skill for professional software engineering roles.

---

## 🚀 Potential Improvements
- Add multiple quiz categories
- Implement difficulty levels
- Persist scores to a file or database
- Integrate with a public trivia API
- Add stronger input validation
- Implement unit testing
- Convert into a GUI application (Tkinter)
- Build a web-based version using Flask or FastAPI

---

## ✅ Outcome
By completing this project, the learner gains:

- Practical experience building multi-file Python applications
- Stronger understanding of object-oriented design
- Improved architectural thinking
- Experience managing program state
- A portfolio-ready intermediate Python project
