# 🎮 Hangman Game

## 📖 Description
This project is a command-line implementation of the classic **Hangman** game built using Python. The player attempts to guess a randomly selected word one letter at a time while avoiding running out of lives. The game provides visual feedback using ASCII art and tracks progress until the player either wins or loses.

## 🎯 Objective
To guess the hidden word correctly before all lives are lost by making informed letter guesses.

## 🕹️ How the Game Works
1. A random word is selected from a predefined word list.
2. The player starts with a fixed number of lives.
3. The player guesses one letter at a time.
4. Correct guesses reveal letters in the word.
5. Incorrect guesses reduce the number of remaining lives.
6. The game ends when the word is fully revealed or when all lives are lost.
7. ASCII art visually represents the hangman’s state after each incorrect guess.
