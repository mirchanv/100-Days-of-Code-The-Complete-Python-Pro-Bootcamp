# 💻 Higher Lower Followers Game (Python)

## 📖 Project Overview
This project is an interactive **command-line Higher Lower Game** built in Python. Instead of guessing numbers, the player compares **social media follower counts** between two public figures, brands, or entities and must correctly choose which one has more followers. The game continues as long as the player keeps guessing correctly, reinforcing decision-making and control flow concepts.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Practice using functions to organize game logic
- Understand random data selection in Python
- Apply conditional logic to compare values
- Work with loops to control game flow
- Handle user input and feedback

---

## 🕹️ Key Features
- Random comparison between two accounts
- Continuous score tracking for correct answers
- Prevention of repeated account comparisons
- Real-time win/lose feedback
- Clear game-ending condition with final score display

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered
- Functions and return values
- Conditional statements (`if / elif / else`)
- While loops for continuous gameplay
- User input handling
- Game state management
- Modular and readable code design

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Python Standard Library
  - `random`
- Custom modules
  - `game_data.py` (account follower dataset)
  - `art.py` (ASCII logo and VS display)

---

## 📌 Game Rules
- Two accounts are displayed to the player
- The player must guess which account has **more followers**
- Each correct guess:
  - Increases the score
  - Continues the game with a new comparison
- The game ends when the player makes an incorrect guess
- The final score is displayed at the end

---

## 📌 Purpose
The purpose of this project is to strengthen **core Python programming skills** by implementing a simple but complete game loop. It focuses on logic, flow control, and user interaction—key foundations for larger applications.

---

## ✅ Outcome
By completing this project, the learner gains:
- Confidence working with loops and conditionals
- Experience structuring small Python programs
- Improved understanding of game logic and state
- A solid beginner-friendly project for a Python portfolio
